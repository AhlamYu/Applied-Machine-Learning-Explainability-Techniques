    "The methods explored in this notebook, are all model agnostic approaches for explaining black-box models. These methods are very simple to execute and quite human friendly depending on the Surrogate Explainer methods used. Also, the result visualizations doesn't need any complicated level of understanding, so very effective for business stakeholders. But the major drawback is that these methods doesn't include the information learnt from the actual model. The actual model might learn important information and might unravel certain critical features which might not be picked up the Surrogate models. Overall, this is one of the most common methods for explaining black-box models, mainly because of its simplicity. Try out this method for regression based problems."
